# Map Reduce

![](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-java.svg) 


The goals of this project is to:
- Create suitable unbalanced dataset, to simulate real world FL system and evaluate corresponding methods.
- Build FL model with existing machine learning framework using basic model aggregation such as averaged weights update ($Fed\Avg$)
- Investigate the effect of parameters: number of clients, rounds, epochs, learning rate, optimisation functions on the global model
Benchmark the FL algorithm, use metrics such as learning accuracy and loss to evaluate model performance and convergence rate by deploying different communication reduction strategies
